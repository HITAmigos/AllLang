<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Meteor is an ultra-simple environment for building modern websites. What once took weeks, even with the best tools, now takes hours with Meteor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The web was originally designed to work in the same way that mainframes worked in the 70s. The application server rendered a screen and sent it over the network to a dumb terminal. Whenever the user did anything, that server rerendered a whole new screen. This model served the Web well for over a decade. It gave rise to LAMP, Rails, Django, PHP.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the best teams, with the biggest budgets and the longest schedules, now build applications in JavaScript that run on the client. These apps have stellar interfaces. They don’t reload pages. They are reactive: changes from any client immediately appear on everyone’s screen.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They’ve built them the hard way. Meteor makes it an order of magnitude simpler, and a lot more fun. You can build a complete application in a weekend, or a sufficiently caffeinated hackathon. No longer do you need to provision server resources, or deploy API endpoints in the cloud, or manage a database, or wrangle an ORM layer, or swap back and forth between JavaScript and Ruby, or broadcast data invalidations to clients. Meteor Supports OS X, Windows, and Linux. // https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Supported-Platforms On Windows? https://install.meteor.com/windows On OS X or Linux? Install the latest official Meteor release from your terminal: $ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh The Windows installer supports Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2012. The command line installer supports Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) and above, and Linux on x86 and x86_64 architectures.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once you’ve installed Meteor, create a project: meteor create myapp Run it locally:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cd myapp meteor</span></p>
<h1 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.1px 0.0px; line-height: 28.0px; font: 24.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>Meteor server running on: http://localhost:3000/</b></span></h1>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then, open a new terminal tab and unleash it on the world (on a free server we provide):</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Principles of Meteor</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Data on the Wire. Meteor doesn’t send HTML over the network. The server sends data and lets the client render it.<br>
</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">One Language. Meteor lets you write both the client and the server parts of your application in JavaScript.<br>
</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Database Everywhere. You can use the same methods to access your database from the client or the server.<br>
</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Latency Compensation. On the client, Meteor prefetches data and simulates models to make it look like server method calls return instantly.<br>
</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Full Stack Reactivity. In Meteor, realtime is the default. All layers, from database to template, update themselves automatically when necessary.<br>
</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Embrace the Ecosystem. Meteor is open source and integrates with existing open source tools and frameworks.<br>
</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Simplicity Equals Productivity. The best way to make something seem simple is to have it actually be simple. Meteor’s main functionality has clean, classically beautiful APIs.<br>
</span></li>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Meteor is two things:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A library of packages: pre-written, self-contained modules that you might need in your app.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are about a dozen core Meteor packages that most any app will use. Two examples: webapp, which handles incoming HTTP connections, and templating, which lets you make HTML templates that automatically update live as data changes. Then there are optional packages like email, which lets your app send emails, or the Meteor Accounts series (accounts-password, accounts-facebook, accounts-ui, and others) which provide a full-featured user account system that you can drop right into your app. In addition to these “core” packages, there are thousands of community-written packages in Atmosphere, one of which might do just what you need.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A command-line tool called meteor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">meteor is a build tool analogous to make, rake, or the non-visual parts of Visual Studio. It gathers up all of the source files and assets in your application, carries out any necessary build steps (such as compiling CoffeeScript, minifying CSS, building npm modules, or generating source maps), fetches the packages used by your app, and outputs a standalone, ready-to-run application bundle. In development mode it can do all of this interactively, so that whenever you change a file you immediately see the changes in your browser. It’s super easy to use out of the box, but it’s also extensible: you can add support for new languages and compilers by adding build plugin packages to your app.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The key idea in the Meteor package system is that everything should work identically in the browser and on the server (wherever it makes sense, of course: browsers can’t send email and servers can’t capture mouse events). Our whole ecosystem has been built from the ground up to support this.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A Meteor application is a mix of client-side JavaScript that runs inside a web browser or PhoneGap mobile app, server-side JavaScript that runs on the Meteor server inside a Node.js container, and all the supporting HTML templates, CSS rules, and static assets. Meteor automates the packaging and transmission of these different components, and it is quite flexible about how you choose to structure those components in your file tree.</span></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.9px 0.0px; line-height: 22.0px; font: 18.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>Special Directories</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By default, any JavaScript files in your Meteor folder are bundled and sent to the client and the server. However, the names of the files and directories inside your project can affect their load order, where they are loaded, and some other characteristics. Here is a list of file and directory names that are treated specially by Meteor:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">client</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Any directory named client is not loaded on the server. Similar to wrapping your code in if (Meteor.isClient) { … }. All files loaded on the client are automatically concatenated and minified when in production mode. In development mode, JavaScript and CSS files are not minified, to make debugging easier. (CSS files are still combined into a single file for consistency between production and development, because changing the CSS file’s URL affects how URLs in it are processed.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HTML files in a Meteor application are treated quite a bit differently from a server-side framework. Meteor scans all the HTML files in your directory for three top-level elements: , , and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
